HOW TO RUN:
1)	gcc main.c -lpthread
2)	./a.out

IntegerList.txt is hardcoded in the program  *** 


ASSIGNMENT: 

"design and implement a C program that utilizes
multithreading to accomplish the task of integer sorting. Specifically, a list of integers should
be divided into two sub-lists of integers by your program. The size of the sub-lists should be
the same (note that when the total number of integers is odd, the integer in the middle of the
list should only be included one of the sub-lists). Then two separate threads (which are called
“sorting threads”) are created. Each of them sorts a sub-list using a sorting algorithm of your
choice. Finally, the sorted sub-lists are merged into a single sorted list by a third thread
(which is called “merging thread”)."
